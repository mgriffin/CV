\section{Experience}
\cventry{2007--Present}{ICT Officer}{National Museum of Ireland}{}{}{
  Responsibilities include:%
  \begin{itemize}%
    \item Deskside support for 200 people spread over six sites;
    \item Server support, configuration and backup for 35 servers;
    \item Network analysis and monitoring;
    \item Support for exhibition interactive displays.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{description}%
    \item[Virtualised server infrastructure leading to reduced support calls and energy costs] \
      \newline{} By running virtualised servers, we can expand or contract the resources needed without down time. Also by using fewer physical servers, we saved significant energy costs.
    \item[Installed network monitoring using Nagios and Cacti] \
      \newline{} Using a disused server, this machine now monitors the switches, routers, servers and printers. We are notified of problems or potential problems before the users are aware of them and this leads to a more positive view of the ICT department.
    \item[Introduced git as department side VCS] \
      \newline{} All code and configuration files are now version controlled and easier to change and audit.
    \item[Introduced Jenkins CI ] \
      \newline{} Jenkins runs the tests needed to ensure that we haven't introduced any bugs when adding features and automatically pushes the code to the production site.
    \item[Oversaw the introduction of SCCM] \
      \newline{} We use SCCM to install new desktop machines and ensure that they have the correct configuration for the domain.
    \item[Specced and wrote a digital signage system] \
      \newline{} The backend is in PHP and allows the education staff to upload events as they plan them. This information can then be viewed by the public on screens in each reception area. The data is also used to create a quartetly calendar of events that is sent to museum subscribers.
    \item[Continual upgrades and improvements to a bespoke education booking system] \
      \newline{} I am the main point of support for a system that the education department use to create and keep track of bookings. The system is written in ASP.NET and uses MSSQL as its backend. Javascript is also used to provide a speedier user experience.
    \item[Helped to install Openfire as a Jabber server for internal communication] \
      \newline{} This was a proof of concept solution that was eventually demoted as there wasn't sufficient interest.
